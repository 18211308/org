_For this call, you are encouraged to turn your video on. This is a good way to build rapport given we are a large, disparate group experiencing a lot of churn._

_This document is live-edited DURING each call, and stable/authoritative copies live on our github repo under /agenda.md. Please note that we might not notice a pullrequest in time, but you are free to propose agenda items for future meetings via hackmd._
