# Starting a group at DIF

Contact: community@identity.foundation

## Decide the group type
First, decide which group type is appropriate for your needs:
- Working Group: IPR-protected group that produces technical specifications or other artifacts. Participants must be DIF members.
- Special Interest Group: Open group serving as a cooperative space to align on common areas of interest and encourage ideation
- User Group: Open group consisting of users interested in a DIF codebase

It's also possible that your idea can be accomplished as a work item in an existing group. 

See [Participation](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/dif_org_faq.md#participation) for more details.
