## Universal Style Guidance
High level guidance for all writing about DIF, whether in member submissions or otherwise:
* Never forget the prime directive of Nemethi: “DIF should never side with any tech over another unless it's siding with SSI over a non-SSI alternative.”
* Universal statements about technological breakthroughs, best practices, or other blanket pronouncements are to be avoided, particularly in reference to participation in DIF
   * scoping claims to a specific set of use cases or market contexts is strongly advised
   * Attributing any judgment or opinion to a specific individual or organization is always better than leaving it ambiguous whether that individual speaks on behalf of DIF
* Always speak positively and respectfully of the organizations in the first or second tiers of DIF’s organization tracker
   * Always link to the homepage or website of these organizations at least once per article
   * Avoid contrasting DIF’s approach to that of other open-source foundations working in the decentralized identity space-- complementary or win-win framings are strongly encouraged to discourage the appearance of antagonism or competition
* For other high-level guidance, see the [Brand Guidelines](brand-guidelines.md)

## Medium

Authorship
* Original posts should be signed by the DIF generic account unless there is a compelling reason to sign a post individually. Examples include:
   * First-hand experience or expertise pertinent to the subject
   * Short-term guest editor, contributor, “resident”, etc
* Member contributions should be signed by the contributing organization’s comms account or a member of that organization, preferably with the organization’s name in their bio.

Business Interests
* Collaborations are best framed as some mixture of community endeavor and consortium of organizations pursuing long-term investments in products or services.
* Stay positive and professional when referring to the products and services of competitors or prior art, whether in our outside of the decentralized identity sphere; use the concept of obsolescence sparingly and respectfully
* Taboos: in addition to obvious guardrails around patents and IPR topics, it is generally preferable not to mention mergers and acquisitions, litigation, etc.

Style
* Paragraphing: topical/journalistic paragraphing, 8-10 verbs per paragraph, preferably with a strong statement in first or second position. 
* Tone: Professional and skimmable but still personalized tone.
* Bold accent phrases to facilitate skimming, average 1.2 per paragraph.
* Quotations: Pullout quotes use as sidebars, with Medium pullquote formatting to be used sparingly, once or twice per article; inline quotes are preferred for shorter quotes.
* Illustrations are best kept to a minimum: 1 “splash image” (for Medium preview) is plenty, and diagrams should be supplemental to context, not more than one per 5 minutes of reading time.  If more than that are necessary, consider publishing a PDF or slide deck instead, or linking to one from the story
* Links: Links are best anchored to the descriptive noun (i.e. “In his 2020 article, Juan writes…”) rather than to the name of the source or the word “link” or “here”
   * For multiple links, follow the same convention but one link per word (o.e. “In article after article, Juan rants…”)

Section-specific guidance
* Education section: tone can be a bit more informal and personal; more frequent links are preferable

## Twitter

Feed ergonomics
* Tweets should appear at regular intervals, usually no more than once per day
* Tweets announcing blog posts, specs, or the release/ratification of other deliverables should be timed for bi-coastal business hours (i.e., the between 9-3 PT/12-6 ET)

Website
* Feed ergonomics
