*Note: this overview was created by combining section 7 of the underlying JDF [charter](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/Membership%20agreements/DIF%20Project%20Charter%20_4.0.2.pdf) with the October 2020 [addendum](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/Membership%20agreements/Project%20Charter%20Addendum.md) to be readable as a consolidated overview. It is not an authoritative document, so if you find any discrepancies, those two linked documents are the authoritative documents.*

### Deliverable Development Process.

7.1. **Pre-Draft**. Any Working Group Participant or Contributor may submit a proposed initial draft document as a candidate Draft Deliverable of that Working Group. The Working Group chair will designate each submission as a “Pre-Draft” document.
1. A Pre-Draft MAY BE referred to as a “Straw man” internally
2. Additional “Straw men” can serve as input documents to a Draft Deliverable, in part or in whole, and can be submitted after a Draft has been initiated at the discretion of the chairs.

7.2. **Draft**. Each Pre-Draft document of a Working Group must first be Approved by the Working Group Participants of that Working Group to become a Draft Deliverable. Once the Working Group approves a document as a Draft Deliverable, the Draft Deliverable becomes the basis for all going forward work on that deliverable.
1. **Versioning** of specifications or code *SHALL* apply to every change affecting normative statements and/or test vectors.
2. All released versions of a draft *SHALL* be accessible at a static and **permanent URL**, tracked by DIF. (This is to minimize risk of editorial error or “overwriting” of significant changes).
3. Work items or their groups *MAY* customize the standard **contributor guidelines** template. SemVer.org-conformant versioning is the expectation, and if other conventions will be used, guidance should be published in the governing contributor guidelines document.

7.3. **Working Group Approval**. Once a Working Group believes it has achieved the objectives for its deliverable as described in the Scope, it will progress its Draft Deliverable to “Working Group Approved” status.
1. Where protocols or interfaces are being specified, a section explicitly defining **test vectors for conformance testing** SHALL be written at time of approving a draft or earlier.
2. Approved drafts should be put at a **permanent link** tracked on DIF's website or github.

7.4. **Final Approval**. Upon a Draft Deliverable reaching Working Group Approved status, the Executive Director or his/her designee will present that Working Group Approved Draft Deliverable to the Steering Committee for Approval. Upon Approval by the Steering Committee, that Draft Deliverable will be designated an “Approved Deliverable.”
1. Final approval by DIF is referred to as “DIF Ratified Deliverable" or "DIF Ratified Specification” internally
2. The steering committee *MAY* invite **external review** of test vectors and normative statements at this point, regardless of whether the Draft will proceed to step 7.6 or only to step 7.5

7.5. **Publication and Submission**. Upon the designation of a Draft Deliverable as an Approved Deliverable, the Executive Director will publish the Approved Deliverable in a manner agreed upon by the Working Group Participants (i.e., Project Participant only location, publicly available location, Project maintained website, Project member website, etc.). The publication of an Approved Deliverable in a publicly accessible manner must include the terms under which the Approved Deliverable and/or source code is being made available under, as set forth in the applicable Working Group Charter.

7.6. **Submissions to Standards Bodies**. No Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable may be submitted to another standards development organization without Approval by the Steering Committee. Upon Approval by the Steering Committee, the Executive Director will coordinate the submission of the applicable Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable to another
standards development organization with Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC. Working Group Participants that developed that Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable agree to grant the copyright rights necessary to make those submissions.
