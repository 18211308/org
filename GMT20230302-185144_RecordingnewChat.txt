00:24:19	Sid: Can someone post some reference links to dweb nodes?

00:27:55	Prashant Mittal: Are there Data Privacy Considerations like GDPR. And how are they taken care of in this kins of a paradigm
00:28:40	Stephan Baur (Kaiser Permanente): Can we hear more about the bottom layer: IPLD Multiformats? It used to say IPFS‚Ä¶
00:31:16	Maria Teresa Aarao: How do you compare WebNode and Tim Berners Lee PODS/SOLID ?
00:31:37	Drummond Reed: So in terms of short-form pronunciation, what I‚Äôm hearing is ‚ÄúD-web nodes‚Äù. Sounds good.
00:33:02	Paul (DIF): https://ipld.io/
00:34:42	Mehran Shakeri: Does DWN allows or foresees applications that need cross user/company synchronisation? E.g., DeFi applications that pose double-spend risks or supply chain applications including international participants to be synced
00:37:33	Daniel Buchner: https://gist.github.com/csuwildcat/0d1b1da0d9ced0555b15c4b61b306c19
00:41:03	Prashant Mittal: capability objects
00:43:50	Moises Jaramillo: Memory blocks that are chained in a DAG
00:44:00	Moises Jaramillo: But don‚Äôt get persisted to the IPFS network
00:45:54	Kabir Maiga: What is the best way to ensure that recipients of PII access via DWN are not persistently storing the information using their own digital agent?
00:49:38	Moises Jaramillo: A follow up question to what Henry just said: The in-browser embedded DWN does have storage restrictions. Let‚Äôs say I have a second DWN hosted by some provider, can the second DWN use a different store, and have both DID‚Äôs DWNs be in sync?
01:05:37	Gene Quinn: Thanks, Daniel and all, for this DWN session. I‚Äôve got to hop to another meeting. Cheers!
01:06:20	Stephan Baur (Kaiser Permanente): Would a DWN support the notion of a computational enclave that allows to securely execute someone else‚Äôs code to access the DWN‚Äôs data, e.g., a federated ML model that then the user can control what it sends back out to the sender of the model?
01:11:27	Limari Navarrete (DIF): If anyone has any follow up questions after the call please email me at limari@identity.foundation
