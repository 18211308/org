1.) DIF accepts donations of “clean IPR” only, meaning original work done by member organizations. If a repository or work item has accepted contributions from non-employees, please reach out to working group chairs or DIF staff to discuss; CLAs may be required for any non-employee contributions. Furthermore, if you have any questions about code dependencies or their licensing, also reach out.

2.) Write to the chairs of the DIF group to which you are donating, and CC donation@identity.foundation -- email should contain:
the github organization that will be transferring a repo to DIF
the github handle that will be maintaining the item once it moves to DIF. (This person should have an employment or IPR relationship with a member of that group)
A simple one-sentence declaration that this is being donated by a working group member that was the sole contributor. 

3.) Schedule a time to effect the transfer with DIF staff. (requires Admin approval) 

4.) “Transfer” the repository under repository settings, at the end of the general settings in the “Danger Zone”.

6.) On the “Team access” selection page, please select the team corresponding to the working group to which you are donating the repository and its IPR. The code maintainer listed in 2B should already be a member of that group. Access and other settings can only be set by group chairs, by default.
