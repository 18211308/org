00:26:45	Benny Jung:	VP can be used among other decentralized identity wallets (platforms)?
00:37:30	alexanderyenkalov:	Hi, its Alex Yenkalov from Portabl. Are there any plans to standardise the logic for presentation definition evaluation and in particular a standardisation around the interface for such evaluation? The goal is to allow implementers building a list of options for VC holder, so that holder can chose which exact match to select for presentation. Thank You.
00:41:23	Benny Jung:	Thank you.
00:45:57	Justin Richer:	Optional disclosure is impractical in most cases once you go to implement it.
00:50:41	Kaliya Identity Woman:	Good standards practice means that different little standards all fit together - in a family.
00:53:02	Rohit Jhunjhunwala:	That's very interesting with options in California

01:01:59	Tom Jones:	The fields object MAY contain an optional property. The value of this property MUST be a boolean, wherein true indicates the field is optional, and false or non-presence of the property indicates the field is required. Even when the optional property is present, the value located at the indicated path of the field MUST validate against the JSON Schema filter, if a filter is present.
