1
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.310
Limari Navarrete: Okay, perfect. So i'm gonna give a little bit of an introduction, and then i'll hand it over to Brent.

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:18.750
Limari Navarrete: So I want to welcome everyone to the third in our series of Amas here at the decentralized identity foundation.

3
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.140
Limari Navarrete: So

4
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:30.580
Limari Navarrete: today we are joined by Brent Zoom Dell, who is the principal cryptography engineer at Jen, and who is also a very active member at Diff.

5
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:46.560
Limari Navarrete: A couple of things to note before we get started today is that if you are interested in joining diff. If you're new to the community, please check out our membership page or our membership options, i'm happy to go over them with you.

6
00:00:47.130 --> 00:01:01.990
Limari Navarrete: and also, if you are a little bit lost at this, we are having a new member orientation next week, so I am the senior director of community engagement. So if you're ever lost around our community, i'm happy to help you find your way.

7
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:12.450
Limari Navarrete: I'm going to be dropping that in the zoom chat as well. So if you want to join me next week, you're welcome to hop on there as well.

8
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:28.100
Limari Navarrete: So the way the way we're going to do this is Brent gonna give a little bit of an overview on President Presentation Exchange, and then after that we're going to field questions so you can ask absolutely anything about presentation exchange. You can do so in the chat.

9
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:40.260
Limari Navarrete: I will read the questions from the chat, but also you can ask questions from the room. You can go ahead and raise your hand, and you can find that under and the toolbar under reactions. You'll be able to do that there.

10
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:50.510
Limari Navarrete: So with that, said I'm going to go ahead and hand it over to Brent to give us an introduction, and then we'll field questions. So take it away, Brent.

11
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:58.700
Brent Zundel: Thank you, Lamari. I'll go ahead and share my screen hopefully where you can see that

12
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.520
Brent Zundel: this is just a basic introduction to a presentation exchange

13
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:13.080
Brent Zundel: for anybody who wants to know anything about it. As Lamari said, my name is Brendan Dell. I work for Jen

14
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.870
Brent Zundel: Jen. It was recently renamed, so people might not recognize it, but they are the company who

15
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.340
Brent Zundel: produces the vast antivirus software as well as Norton life, Lock

16
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.030
Brent Zundel: a vera avg that whole family of things.

17
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:43.320
Brent Zundel: I'm here talking because I helped to edit the presentation Exchange specs. I also chair the applied working group at Diff.

18
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.740
Brent Zundel: I guess i'm also on the steering committee. I probably should have put that on this on this slide

19
00:02:47.750 --> 00:03:04.560
Brent Zundel: elsewhere in the ecosystem. I'm. Also pretty involved with verifiable credentials decentralized identifiers over at W. 3, C. And I'm. Starting to work on Jason webproofs, bbs, and selective disclosure jots at Itf.

20
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.040
Brent Zundel: So a little bit of everything everywhere.

21
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.120
Brent Zundel: just some brief introduction to Presentation Exchange.

22
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.770
Brent Zundel: Presentation Exchange is intended to be a claim, format and transport, agnostic

23
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.220
Brent Zundel: request and response protocol for claims made in Json.

24
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:34.450
Brent Zundel: so it should be able to be used with any Jason claim format whether that's a jot. The Vc. Jason L. The Sd. Jot any any Json formatted claim.

25
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.660
Brent Zundel: and Additionally, it can be used with O Itc. Didcom credential handler Api

26
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:56.320
Brent Zundel: The it's really agnostic to that the basic design there's 2 parts. There's a presentation. Definition this is the thing the verifier sends to a holder to ask for stuff.

27
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:07.140
Brent Zundel: The presentation submission is returned along with the stuff by the holder to explain how it maps back to the definition

28
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:15.720
Brent Zundel: it's designed to be pretty powerful, and enable a lot of flexibility for the verifier in requesting things.

29
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:25.710
Brent Zundel: But it's pretty straightforward and it's hard. A presentation is a set of requested inputs.

30
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.430
Brent Zundel: Each input, has an Id. and it has a constraints object.

31
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:41.010
Brent Zundel: The inputs can also have names purposes, the format descriptions. To say this is the format of the thing that i'm. Looking for

32
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:54.130
Brent Zundel: the constraints. Object is where the presentation definition describes the requested fields. So these are the inputs that the verifier is seeking from the holder.

33
00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.200
Brent Zundel: The only other thing that the constraints might have in it is a flag to indicate that

34
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:09.630
Brent Zundel: the verifier wants to limit the disclosure of of things. So they don't want the holder to return anything they're not explicitly asking for.

35
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:23.040
Brent Zundel: And that's it. That's a presentation definition that it's at its simplest. There are some additional features that allow for greater flexibility. The first of these is called the submission requirements.

36
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.130
Brent Zundel: the submission requirements as a group object.

37
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.100
Brent Zundel: our yeah group property rather

38
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.680
Brent Zundel: to the.

39
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.780
Brent Zundel: to the, input, to Scriptures, so that different logical statements can be made

40
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.080
Brent Zundel: by the verifier.

41
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:55.870
Brent Zundel: you know. Give me one thing from group a. Give me everything from Group B, and give me 2 things from group, c. Or in you know, plain English. I want to see your full name, but it can come from either your birth certificate, or your driver's license.

42
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:07.580
Brent Zundel: One addition like this feature changes it so that instead of requiring that all input descriptors be fulfilled now, all submission requirements would need to be fulfilled.

43
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:16.120
Brent Zundel: Another feature that can be added on time to the on top of the core. Presentation definition is the idea of a predicate. The predicate

44
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:27.860
Brent Zundel: format it. It's kind of experimental at this point, but it allows for Json schema filters to be used to compute Boolean values, so that those can be returned

45
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.390
Brent Zundel: rather than the actual values that are held in the claims.

46
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.620
Brent Zundel: 4 more features that are defined

47
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.320
Brent Zundel: for presentation definitions. One is what we call relational constraints.

48
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.560
Brent Zundel: so each of the fields

49
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.110
Brent Zundel: in you know, claim

50
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:57.400
Brent Zundel: can the thing that gets returned? There's subject is issue, or that means as a verifier want to see something that has been attested by the

51
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.000
Brent Zundel: the issuer i'm. With the subject of the thing that is claimed to be the same as the holder.

52
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.020
Brent Zundel: which is different than his holder in some way. And so i'm explaining this badly.

53
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.670
Brent Zundel: It's basically an imagine you are submitting.

54
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:29.460
Brent Zundel: The verifier is a university, and they want you to with your application, include your transcript which has been issued to you, and they also want an essay, and they want to make sure that essay was written by you, and so they would indicate that the

55
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:36.190
Brent Zundel: subject of the essay must be the issuer of the essay, which is you so

56
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.860
Brent Zundel: hopefully that's not too confusing. The is holder. Constraint

57
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:53.130
Brent Zundel: is away from the verifier to say, okay, I want these 5 fields. But these 2, the person who's submitting them to me needs to be the subject of those fields.

58
00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:03.820
Brent Zundel: For example, if you're submitting name from a birth certificate, the whole, the the verifier could say All right.

59
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.440
Brent Zundel: In addition to give me the name from this

60
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:14.010
Brent Zundel: birth certificate. I also want you to be the subject of the birth certificate. The person holding and submitting needs to also be the subject

61
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:22.960
Brent Zundel: similar to that the same subject, relational constraint allows for any 2 fields from any

62
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.020
Brent Zundel: collection of of claims to be required to be the same subject.

63
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:37.620
Brent Zundel: For example, if you were, if the verifier was requesting information about a vehicle, they could say, All right. I want to know the

64
00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:44.370
Brent Zundel: the payoff value and the current mileage of the you know.

65
00:08:44.610 --> 00:09:00.320
Brent Zundel: 1965 link and continental, and that information could come from a variety of different claims. But the subjects all has to be that same car, so you wouldn't be able to take the mileage from your, you know 2,020

66
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:07.370
Brent Zundel: subaru, and attach it to your claim of ownership for your 1,965 linkedin continent.

67
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:19.090
Brent Zundel: so that's the relational constraints. Other features are a a status so the verifier can require that credentials be active and not revoked

68
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:30.300
Brent Zundel: There we threw in the ability to add a framing object. The framing objects are handy when dealing with Jason Ld. Credentials that support selective disclosure.

69
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:41.890
Brent Zundel: And then the retention feature is something that we added in order to be more compatible with the mobile drivers licenses. This allows the verifier to say

70
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:48.520
Brent Zundel: of these fields that I'm. Requesting this one is one I plan to keep, and here's my you know.

71
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.340
Brent Zundel: Here's what I plan to do with it.

72
00:09:51.160 --> 00:10:00.340
Brent Zundel: And that's presentation definition. You can see it starts off simple, but then grows in potential complexity according to the needs of the verifier.

73
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:08.330
Brent Zundel: contrasting to that, the presentation submission is really simple. The presentation definition

74
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:15.340
Brent Zundel: points to the definition of the idea of the presentation definition that it's related to.

75
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.960
Brent Zundel: and then says, okay for each input that you've requested from me.

76
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.890
Brent Zundel: Here's what I gave you. Here's how it maps to the actual claims that i'm submitting.

77
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:35.510
Brent Zundel: And the presentation. and that's it for a presentation submission. So that's that's the basics of what presentation Exchange contains. Happy to

78
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.660
Brent Zundel: field questions and and

79
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.290
Brent Zundel: chat about whatever you guys want to chat about

80
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:49.100
Limari Navarrete: So it does look like. There was one question that came through the chat.

81
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.790
Limari Navarrete: which is, can

82
00:10:53.790 --> 00:11:01.510
Limari Navarrete: so verifiable presentation can be used among other decentralized identity wallet platforms. It's question work.

83
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:10.700
Brent Zundel: so i'm taking that to be, can Presentation Exchange be used regardless of the wallet or the platform

84
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.940
Brent Zundel: right now, as long as the claims are

85
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.120
Brent Zundel: format, it is Jason then. Yes.

86
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:37.220
Brent Zundel: so there's that's the the only constraint, because we've built Presentation exchange on top of Jason's schema, and on top of Jason path we're deliberately building on a platform of Json formatted claims and credentials. So as long as the credentials

87
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:42.200
Brent Zundel: are written in Json. Then a verifier should be able to use presentation exchange

88
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.560
Brent Zundel: to

89
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.350
Brent Zundel: interact with the holder and request them.

90
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:52.220
Limari Navarrete: Okay, did that answer your question, Benny? That was from Benny Benny Jung.

91
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:09.080
Limari Navarrete: he said. No. any. Do you want? Do you want to unmute yourself and go ahead and ask the question verbally?

92
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.970
Limari Navarrete: Okay, i'm not hearing anything.

93
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.620
Limari Navarrete: Well, we can circle. We can circle back around if you.

94
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:35.030
Limari Navarrete: We can circle back around to you in just a moment. But if anybody else wants to ask a question. Go ahead and drop it in the chat.

95
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:41.290
Limari Navarrete: or you can raise your hand in the room. Any other questions on Presentation Exchange.

96
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.610
Tom Jones: I don't actually see how to raise my hand. I'm sorry

97
00:12:54.340 --> 00:13:08.180
Limari Navarrete: it's it's fine that's Tom right. It's down in reactions. It should be. I don't know if you're on a desktop, but it's at the bottom of the screen in the toolbar. It says reactions. If you press reactions, you should see a raised hand button.

98
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:15.440
Limari Navarrete: But but right now we have Steve in the queue. So i'm gonna go ahead and and let Steve ask his question first.

99
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:27.280
Steve Magennis: Thanks, Lori. Just quick question. Help me understand the the the mapping a little bit better. So, as I understand it, you you essentially have this request, and the verifier will say.

100
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:46.560
Steve Magennis: You know, here are the data elements I want here the conditions of partners you want that I want in the conditions problems that come from. And then, as the the the holder, my job, or my agent Job, is to assemble these things from various credentials and put them forward along with this mapping to the request. Do I have that right so far.

101
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:54.990
Brent Zundel: And in this this is a request. There you you identify these individual things as Id so how do I tie these ids

102
00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:09.310
Steve Magennis: to the, to the various and sundry credentials that I might contain in my walls that have been issued by various organizations, and might be of of different credential formats. Can you help me understand? A little bit better? So on the

103
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.040
Brent Zundel: for the presentation submission?

104
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:20.050
Brent Zundel: First, there's the Id for the definition, saying, I am submitting this information as a response to this particular definition.

105
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.500
Brent Zundel: And then in the descriptor map array.

106
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.690
Brent Zundel: you have.

107
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:32.920
Brent Zundel: you say, okay, Here's the input descriptor that i'm fulfilling. There's an Id for that. and then the

108
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:37.640
Brent Zundel: the holder submits the path of the claim

109
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.300
Brent Zundel: that fulfills it. So if the

110
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.310
Brent Zundel: If the holder is submitting.

111
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:53.120
Brent Zundel: you know, for the input descriptor name, they're submitting the first name from the driver's license credential. They would actually produce the Json Path

112
00:14:53.180 --> 00:15:00.180
Brent Zundel: Description of how to find that value inside of their Driver's license credential that they're submitting.

113
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.190
Steve Magennis: Got it. Okay. It's

114
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.280
Limari Navarrete: okay. Go ahead, Tom.

115
00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:16.740
Tom Jones: Okay. I had 2 questions. I didn't read this spec. I've mounted beforehand. But is it possible when you're

116
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:23.540
Tom Jones: asking for requests whether you can indicate whether it's mandatory that the user respond or optional.

117
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.190
Brent Zundel: So

118
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.910
Tom Jones: this is required, by the way, by California State law.

119
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.520
Brent Zundel: I think the

120
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:52.980
Brent Zundel: in in i'm gonna try to speak for the group of us that that created this thing, and it was our intention that presentation definitions be

121
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.250
Brent Zundel: usable as part of a conversation.

122
00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.420
Brent Zundel: and

123
00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.330
Brent Zundel: you know

124
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:19.200
Brent Zundel: the verifier would present would give a presentation definition to a holder. When that holders wanting to access a service or get some benefit from the from the verify, they want to authorize themselves in some way, or provide information in return for receiving a credential and so built into

125
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:31.380
Brent Zundel: using presentation exchange is the assumption that if the holder doesn't respond. Then there are verifiers obviously not going to give them what they're what they're looking for.

126
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.320
Brent Zundel: but I don't think that quite gets at what you're asking?

127
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:41.220
Brent Zundel: Are you asking about particular fields that are being requested, or the response as a whole

128
00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.310
Tom Jones: particular fields?

129
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:54.210
Brent Zundel: So it's written into the spec that every field that is being requested is expected to be returned. Oh.

130
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.080
Tom Jones: so there's a way to ask for optional fields.

131
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.050
Brent Zundel: There.

132
00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.260
Brent Zundel: There

133
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:19.450
Brent Zundel: is a way to provide optionality to the holder, using submission requirements. You can say you can optionally give me Field a from this credential or field B from this other credential.

134
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.170
Brent Zundel: But one of those would need to be returned.

135
00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:31.590
Brent Zundel: I we explored optionality for a bit, but didn't have a solid use case to draw from it, so we didn't want to.

136
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.710
Brent Zundel: We didn't want to specify something that didn't match how people were actually using it.

137
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:44.660
Tom Jones: Okay, there was. There was a use case that came up. I don't know if you're interested in use cases. But

138
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:51.540
Tom Jones: so the question is that if you go to a bar and you have to be over 21, and they have a

139
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.420
Tom Jones: They have a discount rate. I know it's Ladies night you get 50% off

140
00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:07.150
Tom Jones: so the question is it's required that they that they They tell you that they're over 21, but it isn't required obviously that you indicate what your gender is

141
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.680
Tom Jones: was the one that came up.

142
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:15.320
Tom Jones: I don't mean that you have to respond to it. I just said that that's one of the options that was

143
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:16.220
Tom Jones: right up

144
00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:24.760
Tom Jones: My other question, though it relates more in terms of this. All sounds like it's very verifier oriented, not user oriented or holder oriented.

145
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.730
Tom Jones: It is.

146
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:33.800
Tom Jones: How is how is it possible, given the complexity of this thing that you describe to actually ask for user consent

147
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:40.460
Tom Jones: to provide the data. What does it have to be? Field by field display to the user too.

148
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.580
Brent Zundel: the way that the wallet

149
00:18:45.220 --> 00:19:00.440
Brent Zundel: software interacts with the presentation definition object obviously is going to be up to that. The developers of that wallet software. My expectation is that each field that's being requested would be.

150
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.180
Brent Zundel: you know, very clear to the holder

151
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:04.970
Brent Zundel: what they're sharing.

152
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.320
Tom Jones: It Doesn't work very well for medical information.

153
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.200
Tom Jones: Okay, thanks.

154
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:20.580
Limari Navarrete: Okay. All right. So we do have a follow up from Benny. Further clarification.

155
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:32.200
Limari Navarrete: He was saying. That verifiable presentation exchange, among other ones is a super big problem for ultimate interoperability beyond territories.

156
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.600
Limari Navarrete: He wants to know if you know any efforts

157
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:43.410
Limari Navarrete: in the SSI world for this to please, let us know, especially in any standard bodies.

158
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.620
Limari Navarrete: Is that clear?

159
00:19:45.690 --> 00:20:00.140
Brent Zundel: I'll try. He's having a problem with his Mike. So presentation exchange is currently included as part of the Id. For Vc. Specs

160
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:12.490
Brent Zundel: that are being produced out of the Idf. It's currently incorporated into the Ares profile version 2 as an option for

161
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.640
Brent Zundel: requesting the presentation requests in that ecosystem.

162
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.330
Brent Zundel: So there

163
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:28.460
Brent Zundel: it it is, being. Presentation Exchange is being incorporated as a way to do these things. My understanding is that

164
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:37.040
Brent Zundel: because it's part of Id for Vcs. Then it's also being included in the Iso. Specs for mobile document sharing.

165
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.540
Brent Zundel: So I

166
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:47.560
Brent Zundel: I think the answer is, is, Yes, but i'm still not totally sure what it is. You're asking apologies for that.

167
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:57.850
Limari Navarrete: Okay, Benny, feel free to clarify more if you like, in the chat. But we're gonna move on to the next question.

168
00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.570
Limari Navarrete: I have another question in the chat from

169
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.780
Limari Navarrete: Alexander. who is saying.

170
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.720
Limari Navarrete: Let's see it's Alex from a port top of

171
00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:20.800
alexanderyenkalov: Sorry. I don't know what it portable portable for. We all you're here here. Why, don't you go ahead? And yeah, sure, yeah, cause

172
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:24.710
alexanderyenkalov: oh, yeah, sure I can just do that.

173
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:36.420
alexanderyenkalov: Yeah. The question is about the logic for matching presentation definition to your selected with your credentials basically to select some of those

174
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:52.140
alexanderyenkalov: so far it's not the part of a specification, at least I didn't see any. Maybe I missed some recent updates, but at least there were no like that before. Like to guide how this matching should happen, and what could be the outcome of such a

175
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:56.620
alexanderyenkalov: evaluation of presentation definition, considering the set of your coins.

176
00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:04.520
alexanderyenkalov: Yeah. So pretty much. Everyone who who does that, who whoever you spec like, uses a library from?

177
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.800
alexanderyenkalov: And there is approach to that question there. But questions like from my end is like.

178
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:20.450
alexanderyenkalov: Are there any expectation to standardize that logic? And so the ties in particular, the output of that logic, so that, the goal basically being that

179
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.580
alexanderyenkalov: we, asking the consumer to present some documents

180
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.800
alexanderyenkalov: and business allows for options like one or another.

181
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:48.430
alexanderyenkalov: and we need to build up eventually for a consumer. Yeah, some menu like choose one or another, and to make that convenient, it will be awesome to have some standard approach to evaluation. Just more, I would say, gradular compared to what exist so far in open source.

182
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.100
Brent Zundel: Okay.

183
00:22:50.150 --> 00:23:02.380
Brent Zundel: the the limit to which the presentation exchange spec deals with this is that it defines processing rules for the presentation, definitions and submissions.

184
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:12.820
Brent Zundel: Anything beyond that would be more related to. You know the ux and the rendering of things for the consumers. There

185
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.910
Brent Zundel: is an effort at diff called wallet rendering.

186
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:28.020
Brent Zundel: It's primary focus at this point is from the issuer side, you know, as an issue, or I want to have opinions about how my credential that I've issued is it displayed?

187
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:34.740
Brent Zundel: But I think a natural extension of that would be on the on, the you know this presentation exchange side?

188
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:41.090
Brent Zundel: I. The short answer is, unfortunately, I don't know of any efforts that are

189
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.320
Brent Zundel: being made to standardize that aspect of the exchange.

190
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:52.960
alexanderyenkalov: So basically, so far, like every implementer, does it their own job to to to solve that. Basically.

191
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:53.860
Brent Zundel: Yes.

192
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.710
alexanderyenkalov: Okay, good. So far, Thank you.

193
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:05.240
Limari Navarrete: Okay, Great. Thank you. So we are going to move on to a question from David.

194
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:22.440
David Chadwick: Yeah. Th: this is not actually a a question. Well, it. It's sort of a question, but it's it's also answering what Tam Tom asked about the optionality I haven't looked at the disspect for a few months, but when I, when I did look at it, work on it, Brent, the in terms of selective disclosure.

195
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:39.390
David Chadwick: They used to be a field that it may still be there, which was mandatory to select. This goes all, or you may select. This goes, or you you can ignore it. Is it is that still there, because that would actually provide the optionality. Wouldn't it that Tom was looking for. So you could say, Give your age

196
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:47.080
David Chadwick: selectively, disclose it, but but optionally selective disclosure, and then the user could could present the other details as well if they wanted to.

197
00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.720
Brent Zundel: It's

198
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:55.960
Brent Zundel: it. It flips it around a little bit. The flag that i'm aware of. That's related to. That is the limit. Disclosure, flag.

199
00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:02.550
Brent Zundel: and with limit disclosure. The verifier would say, Give me this information, and nothing more.

200
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.190
Brent Zundel: But

201
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:11.600
Brent Zundel: there's no way to say that I there's no way that I know of for the issue, or to say this field

202
00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.630
Brent Zundel: I want You can answer it if you want to. But you don't have to.

203
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.160
Brent Zundel: which is a slightly different.

204
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:36.740
David Chadwick: Yeah, I agree. Yeah, it's it's it's slightly different. It's it's you you're not. The Verifi is not specifically saying which field is optional. It's, say, this one, you must return, and everything else is optional. Yeah, anything else that you could give me. Go ahead and give it to me or don't.

205
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:46.100
Brent Zundel: But I'm: yeah, I mean, I've taken note of of Tom's use case, and I've always an issue on Presentation Exchange, and we'll have that conversation. See what we can do about that?

206
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.240
Limari Navarrete: Okay, so we're gonna go ahead and take a question from Claire.

207
00:25:55.690 --> 00:26:02.180
Clare Nelson: Sure, Thank you, Lamari. Thank you. Print this is very informative. So i'm gonna ask a Newbie question

208
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:09.870
Clare Nelson: because I have not read the Exchange definition. So Tom mentioned something about a medical

209
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:17.530
Clare Nelson: use case, and I'm very interested in use cases. Can you give me an example, Brand of a use case in the medical field

210
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:26.430
Brent Zundel: a used case in the medical field, I'm. Assuming incorporating presentation, exchange, and definitions.

211
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:31.400
Brent Zundel: Most of most of this would be hypothetical.

212
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:37.700
Brent Zundel: but 1 one option would be.

213
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:46.590
Brent Zundel: The pharmacy is submitting a presentation definition that says, we have to have a properly signed

214
00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:49.750
Brent Zundel: prescription.

215
00:26:49.770 --> 00:27:01.770
Brent Zundel: You need to provide us the name of the drug, whether it can be a generic, the dosage requirements and the you know, the number of days that need to be filled.

216
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:10.960
Brent Zundel: expecting that those that prescription essentially have been issued to the holder from their doctor.

217
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:13.220
Brent Zundel: But, like I said, that's

218
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.540
Brent Zundel: a somewhat contrived on the spot. Example.

219
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:24.920
Brent Zundel: another. Another possibility is using the holder as it means for exchanging medical records between practices.

220
00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:30.770
Brent Zundel: You know, if the doctor's office could issue those

221
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:41.850
Brent Zundel: medical credit medical, that medical information in forms of in form of verifiable credentials. Then the holder would be able to then take those and present that data to any doctor's office that their

222
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.800
Brent Zundel: that they're moving to

223
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.120
Brent Zundel: so hopefully that

224
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:53.350
Brent Zundel: and and and presentation exchange would be useful in all of those, because.

225
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.310
Brent Zundel: especially with

226
00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.950
Brent Zundel: medical information.

227
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:11.030
Brent Zundel: right now, right now, to my understanding. One of the best practices for exchanging data is to encrypt a Pdf. Of everything, and that Pdf. Just gets emailed to the new Doctor's office.

228
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:27.110
Brent Zundel: Presentation exchange would allow for a much more granular level of disclosure. It would allow the receiving Doctor's office to indicate they they don't want to see everything. They only want to see things that pertain to what they're dealing with. Now.

229
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.240
Brent Zundel: just a

230
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:36.880
Brent Zundel: potentially more privacy preserving way of sharing health data. It's at least compatible with that as an ocean.

231
00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:47.240
Clare Nelson: Thank you, Brent. That helps give me and my beginner's mind more insight into the power and flexibility of presentation exchange.

232
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.230
Brent Zundel: Thank you.

233
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:59.390
Limari Navarrete: hey? Awesome! So there was a follow up from Benny asking. So i'm let me see if I can

234
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.530
Limari Navarrete: phrase this in a way that's clear. It's

235
00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:15.930
Limari Navarrete: so. I believe he's asking, When When will there be some presence of presentation? Exchange standards, and the W. 3, C. Such as it did Core Standard.

236
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:24.890
Brent Zundel: Right now? There's no plan to move presentation exchange into W. Threec.

237
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:35.650
Brent Zundel: I. A kind of natural place for it To end up would be as part of the family of specs that are being worked on by the verifiable credentials working group.

238
00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.310
Brent Zundel: Currently, that working group is.

239
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:47.220
Brent Zundel: how do I say? Completely slammed? We? We we have a lot on our plates, and may not even get done what we have

240
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.720
Brent Zundel: planned currently.

241
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:55.730
Brent Zundel: And so the a a natural next step of that work is to say.

242
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:59.100
Brent Zundel: in addition to the data formats that we're producing.

243
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:11.170
Brent Zundel: Here's a protocol essentially, or the meanings of protocol for a verifier to request and a holder to submit that data, and I think that presentation exchange

244
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.270
Brent Zundel: works very well to answer that problem

245
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:23.150
Brent Zundel: when it's going to be officially recognized by the W. 3, c. I wouldn't anticipate that before.

246
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.250
Brent Zundel: you know. Sometime within the next 5 years is certainly possible. It will.

247
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.310
It won't happen with the next one or 2. That's for sure.

248
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.500
Brent Zundel: In the meantime presentation exchange

249
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:39.970
Brent Zundel: continues to be adopted by these other specifications like Id for Vc.

250
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.430
Brent Zundel: And so it's

251
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.940
Brent Zundel: it's seeing real world use. It, seeing really widespread real world use.

252
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:53.910
Brent Zundel: I would go so far as to a certain that it's one of the most successful. You know

253
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.720
Brent Zundel: descriptions of of

254
00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.890
Brent Zundel: how to do something that's come out of diff.

255
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:12.020
Brent Zundel: But it's, you know, as far as being adopted by an International Standards Development organization that hasn't happened yet, though I

256
00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:18.010
Brent Zundel: I would expect it to be incorporated into some W. 3 C. Spec. Sometime in the future.

257
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:32.850
Limari Navarrete: Okay, great. Thank you. All right. So there was a comment from Justin. I think it was based off some of the early earlier discussion. Did you want to follow up Justin with any comments?

258
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.530
Limari Navarrete: See if he said it, responded.

259
00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:50.770
Limari Navarrete: He just made a comment. That optional disclosure is impractical in most cases. Once you go to implement it. So I think that was based off of an earlier discussion.

260
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:56.200
Limari Navarrete: Let me see, and I have something from Kalia.

261
00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:05.560
Tom Jones: Could I add to that comment whether it's practical or not? It's required by law in California, so you can take that or leave it if you will.

262
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.780
Limari Navarrete: Okay, all right. And so let's see when we have something from Kalia.

263
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.970
Limari Navarrete: Did you want to ask any questions or make any comments, Kalia?

264
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.210
Limari Navarrete: She's still in the room.

265
00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:36.490
Limari Navarrete: Okay. I guess not. So. We're down to the end of the questions in the chat. I don't see anyone with their hand up in the room. Are there any other questions.

266
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.340
Limari Navarrete: or follow ups to anything that you asked if you wanted to get more details on.

267
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:57.100
alexanderyenkalov: maybe just one more from my end. Yeah. Question is about the evidence. Yeah, in case well, whether there were already discussions in the group

268
00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:06.250
alexanderyenkalov: or wrong position, change for the evidence. and like, yeah, any feedback so far about how to handle requests and evidence as optional or required thing

269
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.200
alexanderyenkalov: along the way, like well, requesting credentials.

270
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:13.570
Brent Zundel: I'm.

271
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:25.890
alexanderyenkalov: i'm not sure exactly what you're asking. I'm: sorry.

272
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:38.260
alexanderyenkalov: Yeah, that Field is not to explore in the standards so far, I believe that it just hidden in our individual use cases like people just not trying to put it back to the standard group so far.

273
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:53.630
alexanderyenkalov: But I wonder if there were any discussions right now? Well, in the past year, in the position, shade, group around like how we could standardize requesting evidence like I want to get like, say, passport credential, and I want to get some evidence attached to it.

274
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.410
alexanderyenkalov: Let's say without evidence. I would not accept that

275
00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:16.929
Brent Zundel: the the short answer is Yes, presentation, exchange, presentation, definitions, can can be used for that. Whether the evidence exists as a property inside the verifiable credential, or whether the verifier is seeking for additional evidence from a separate credential. The presentation definition can

276
00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.360
Brent Zundel: can certainly do that.

277
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:34.670
alexanderyenkalov: Do? Oh, and then other question. It's more like logistics and priority. Do you think? Bring that question to the group right now would find the time slot to do so, or it will be quite busy right now to get priority on such thing right now.

278
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.170
alexanderyenkalov: like

279
00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:40.980
Brent Zundel: in the verifiable credentials working group for the Vc. Spec.

280
00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:46.670
alexanderyenkalov: In the pack, specifically to standardize, for instance, the format to request such thing.

281
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.690
Brent Zundel: Well, so

282
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:54.960
Brent Zundel: right now, Presentation Exchange, the definition is.

283
00:34:56.239 --> 00:35:04.690
alexanderyenkalov: basically i'm. Speaking of potential to well, to to grow a new version basically of presentation exchange, because I believe, like the lost version is walked, and

284
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:10.280
alexanderyenkalov: maybe I'm: i'm wrong here. But I guess like it's it's a basically a proposal for the next version. It would be

285
00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.290
Brent Zundel: right.

286
00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:25.710
Brent Zundel: So there currently is interest in allowing presentation exchange version to to exist for a while before we, you know, begin actively working on a version. 3:

287
00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:35.900
Brent Zundel: Yeah. The repository is still active, and so issues can still be raised whether or not, there would be interest in

288
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:48.300
Brent Zundel: specifically including a means of asking about evidence as opposed to using the general structures to allow the verifier to seek the evidence.

289
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.010
Brent Zundel: you know, having had a lot of conversations around similar proposals in the past.

290
00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:09.160
Brent Zundel: My guess is that there there probably wouldn't be interest in the group to add something specific for evidence, because there's nothing that would stop a verifier from using presentation exchange, as it currently exists to do that.

291
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:13.060
Brent Zundel: using just the general tools that are available with the

292
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:18.050
alexanderyenkalov: So you mean to ask for some another credential base.

293
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:29.970
Brent Zundel: Right? So so presentation exchange. You can either ask for whatever field you want from a single credential, or you can ask for whatever field you want from any set of credentials in the same definition.

294
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:47.670
alexanderyenkalov: along with indicating relationships between those fields. Yeah, I I I get what you mean. So basically we can request, not just data from credential subject, but we also can require to have the field evidence and have some stuff inside. Yeah, thank you that that's extremely available.

295
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:50.180
alexanderyenkalov: It's. It's very simple. But they're available.

296
00:36:50.250 --> 00:37:08.290
Brent Zundel: Yeah, so like that that's exactly it. You, the the verifier, can say. Give me your verifiable credential. It has to have this information on the credentials subject, but it also has to have an evidence property, and in that evidence property I better see that the passport agency actually checked your biometrics or something. For example.

297
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:12.180
Brent Zundel: it's all possible.

298
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:25.030
Limari Navarrete: Okay, I don't see any other questions in the chat. Do? Are there any other questions

299
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:28.770
Limari Navarrete: in the room? I'll give you guys a second to maybe

300
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:33.580
Limari Navarrete: think about that. And i'm sure there's something stirring.

301
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.880
alexanderyenkalov: I will say that. Yeah, just

302
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:55.730
alexanderyenkalov: I would say the case with selective disclosure plus some optional. If user whales to share it. It's something also available for us in our use cases. So

303
00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:14.300
alexanderyenkalov: yeah, do you think, Brand, there are chances to this have that stuff discussed in the group right now, while why? Because you said version 2 is still open for suggestions like. Could there Could there be interesting to discuss that potentially in the group already Like because I I believe in this group. We already have like 3 people saying about that.

304
00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:17.800
Brent Zundel: I mean it definitely

305
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:24.650
Brent Zundel: definitely could be actually I'm. So i'm looking at the spec now.

306
00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:31.890
Brent Zundel: because I remembered us talking about optional fields. and we actually

307
00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.520
Brent Zundel: merged that capability

308
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.450
Brent Zundel: to have optional fields and October of last year.

309
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:51.110
Brent Zundel: So one of the when basically give me one of these things, and whether you submit it is optional, is

310
00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.170
Brent Zundel: It's in the spec. You can do it.

311
00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.030
alexanderyenkalov: So basically it

312
00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:14.270
alexanderyenkalov: Yeah, yeah, because I just like when you just first touch the topic today, I just got that. Basically there is some crash between these requirements, like limited disclosure and optional like, and may maybe like, depends how you treat that right? So may may be the case that limited this closure just from priority perspective

313
00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:20.620
alexanderyenkalov: like higher, so that we just request this and none else. But in case we treat that like.

314
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.460
alexanderyenkalov: limit the discussion for these things, and you could still do that.

315
00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:30.600
alexanderyenkalov: That is different story, then, that it is the the the, the the scenario nicely.

316
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:44.400
alexanderyenkalov: So it's. It's a question of perspective, how how it's okay, to treat that from the standard perspective, I think maybe maybe it would be good to just yeah, just like to discuss that question in the group and add some more clarification to spec, so that it's

317
00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.990
alexanderyenkalov: like can be used this way and this normal.

318
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:57.260
Brent Zundel: Yeah, I I should apologize for earlier, indicating that optional was something that we hadn't considered because an input descriptor object.

319
00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:05.200
Brent Zundel: you know, we'll have a field, and that field can indicate whether or not the property is optional to this close or not. So it's in there.

320
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.350
alexanderyenkalov: Awesome. Thank you.

321
00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:11.220
Yeah.

322
00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.420
Tom Jones: thanks. What section is that?

323
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:19.870
Brent Zundel: It is in the

324
00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:26.340
Brent Zundel: Input Descriptor Object section I can drop a link directly to that in the chat.

325
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:34.430
Brent Zundel: That would be great. Yeah, so it's in this section. If you scroll down a bit you'll see

326
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.410
Brent Zundel: the optional property I described there.

327
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:52.520
Limari Navarrete: Okay, anyone else any other questions today?

328
00:40:56.150 --> 00:41:02.240
Limari Navarrete: Also, i'm going to drop my email in the chat. So if there are any, follow up questions.

329
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.350
Limari Navarrete: I can go ahead and forward those to Brent.

330
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:11.430
Limari Navarrete: So there's my email. So Marietta identity foundation.

331
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:25.400
Limari Navarrete: And so if there are no other questions, I can give you 15 min back of your time. I just want to give a couple more seconds to see if anybody else

332
00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:32.300
Limari Navarrete: has somebody there, something they're doing, or anything you want to add, Brent.

333
00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.960
Brent Zundel: I'll note that

334
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:39.440
Brent Zundel: immediately. Prior to this meeting is the weekly scheduled

335
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:52.420
Brent Zundel: meeting to discuss presentation exchange along with credential manifest, which is a related specification and occasionally wallet rendering. If folks show up and are interested in talking about that.

336
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.440
Brent Zundel: And so Thursdays

337
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:58.950
Brent Zundel: the hour before the this meeting time.

338
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:04.320
Brent Zundel: Welcome, folks to attend and have that conversation, and bring up whatever you want to bring up.

339
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:11.110
Limari Navarrete: It looks like there was one more question from Tom. Do you want to ask that directly, Tom?

340
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:20.350
Tom Jones: No, that wasn't a question I just pasted in the section that Brent was talking about, so anybody else could see it.

341
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:21.790
Limari Navarrete: Okay, Gotcha.

342
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:26.090
Tom Jones: And it seems to agree that yes, optional is possible.

343
00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.500
Limari Navarrete: Okay, Thank you very much, Tom, appreciate that.

344
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:49.080
Limari Navarrete: Okay. So if there are no other questions, we can go ahead and wrap it up today. I just want to thank everyone for joining us, feel free to reach out for any. Follow up questions. We will be having

345
00:42:49.080 --> 00:43:04.190
Limari Navarrete: future events with our engineering community. So keep on top of our event bright because they will drop directly from there, and of course, just keep on top of our overall communications here at Diff.

346
00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:13.060
Limari Navarrete: So so yeah, thanks. And I hope you guys have a great day evening wherever you are, and we'll see you next time.

347
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:18.010
Clare Nelson: Thanks, Pran. Thanks, Lamari.

348
00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:19.380
alexanderyenkalov: Thank you.

349
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:21.820
Limari Navarrete: Oh, thank you. Everyone.
