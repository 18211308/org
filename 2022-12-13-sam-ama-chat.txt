11:21:48 From Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) to Everyone:
	Following up on the topic of DIDComm adoption, what sorts of metrics do you feel are important? Who should targeted in terms of driving adoption? What things need to be done to help this audience?
11:25:55 From Rob Aaron to Everyone:
	What is DIDComm's relationship/history with Aries? The "Build a protocol" link on DIDComm.org goes to Aries RFC 0003: Protocols on GitHub.
11:26:03 From Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) to Everyone:
	Number of different transports supported?
11:27:23 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Everyone:
	How to get started with DIDComm?
11:30:43 From Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) to Everyone:
	Assuming Web 7.0 is built exclusively using DIDComm and DIDComm Agents, I live this diagram: https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-11.png
11:31:02 From Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) to Everyone:
	...I like this diagram...
11:31:28 From Jay Price to Everyone:
	do we have any developments with the DIDs in regards to self-storaging a complete online data profile? and the ability to manage data based relationships?
11:32:13 From Brent Shambaugh to Everyone:
	This is a guidance question/musing:
	
	I'm looking at did;comm for a secure channel between two agents. One of these agents is an edge hardware device that provides an ephemeral did:key.
	I've done some work over with Mircea on the DID-JWT library. 
	
	JWE looks to be the next step. Alas I already opened an issue. Yay! I get to learn at a deep level how JWE works.
	https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-jwt/issues/225
	
	I actually have not implemented ECDH between two did:key , so this seems to be another place to work to understand as I try to implement the protocol beyond the browser.
11:33:24 From Brent Shambaugh to Everyone:
	Can you implement did:comm on top of websockets?
11:35:46 From Fabio to Everyone:
	OOB message need to be "DIDComm Plaintext Message" or can be a "DIDComm Signed Message"?
11:36:20 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Everyone:
	How / where's DIDComm currently deployed? Anything bigger in production?
11:38:04 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Everyone:
	What's the current state that DIDComm is in in terms of the spec and implementations?
11:38:06 From Limari Navarrete (DIF) to Everyone:
	Can you share a bit about the DIDComm weekly, the DIDComm user group and the DIDComm Unsync at DIF. Can you give us a sense of what the difference is between those groups and how to get involved?
11:38:19 From Lance Byrd to Everyone:

11:39:11 From Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) to Everyone:
	This new whitepaper specifically targets developers and architects wanting to build decentralized identifier and agent software systems:	https://hyperonomy.com/2022/12/11/web-7-0-didcomm-agent-architecture-reference-model-didcomm-arm-0-27/
11:46:37 From Fabio to Everyone:
	Is there already any native JavaScript implementation for `ECHD-1PU` (used by DID Comm to create AUTH encrypt message) and `XC20P` (used by DID Comm for content encryption)?
11:47:31 From Jay Price to Everyone:
	great answer! quick follow up example: after some sort of "proof of humanity" I may want to establish a relationship (either comm or node) but I want to control the access to my data based on time. is there a measure in place to offer an entity an ephemeral DID attached to my permanent? like the key I gave expires after a week.
11:48:50 From Jay Price to Everyone:
	side note: this would be useful because if my data is being stored live, the data I had 6 months ago isn't me now but if an entity has my key they still have access to the data. would that be true?

	The link to the Discord server
11:51:28 From Lance Byrd to Everyone:
	the Aries DIDComm v2 WG meets earlier on Mondays than the DIF WG/UG, in case you want to double dip or if you can't make the later meeting.  several of us meet for both
11:52:03 From Sam Curren (TelegramSam) to Everyone:
	https://github.com/sicpa-dlab/didcomm-rust/tree/main/wasm
11:53:05 From Lance Byrd to Everyone:
	typescript DIDcomm v2 lib that is in the works https://github.com/blu3beri/ssi-ts/tree/main/packages
11:53:09 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Everyone:
	WalletConnect is a service for connecting crypto wallets to Dapps and it seems to be easy to use + widely deployed. How would you compare WalletConnect to DIDComm?
11:54:45 From Brent Shambaugh to Everyone:
	Bob {did:key A} wants to talk to Alice {did:key B). Bob doesn't know anything else about Alice other than her did:key. If this is possible to accomplish with did:comm by sending a query over websockets (as I inferred from your previous answer). this would be awesome.
	This is something I still need to work through, but it is still fun to learn about.
11:55:28 From Fabio to Everyone:
	What tools do you recommend for debugging DID Comm?
	For example, if we have all keys of everyone involved in a communication, is there a proxy able to log all the messages in plaintext?
11:55:58 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Limari Navarrete (DIF)(Direct Message):
	The discord link says: Invite Invalid
11:56:15 From Jay Price to Everyone:
	just wanted to say thanks Sam! and everyone else involved
11:56:49 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Everyone:
	https://walletconnect.com/
11:57:49 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Everyone:
	WalletConnect is in my understanding a WebSocket STUN service that securly connects Dapp + Wallet. Many wallets implement it
11:59:49 From Limari Navarrete (DIF) to Everyone:
	Try this discord link https://discord.gg/5NbKYnvt
12:00:23 From Limari Navarrete (DIF) to Everyone:
	The other one seems to be invalid
12:00:48 From Limari Navarrete (DIF) to JC Ebersbach (identinet)(Direct Message):
	Thank you, dropped  a new one in the chat
12:01:44 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Limari Navarrete (DIF)(Direct Message):
	üëç works well
12:03:44 From Fabio to Everyone:
	Is there any protocol to generate a random number between parties or anyone working on one?
	
	Thanks a lot for all the answers Sam
12:03:54 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Everyone:
	Thanks a lot for all the insights
12:05:15 From Brent Shambaugh to Everyone:
	ceramic network blockchain anchored IPFS...did registry
12:05:22 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Everyone:
	What would you like to see happen with DIDComm next year?
12:05:23 From Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) to Everyone:
	üëç
12:07:02 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Everyone:
	Regarding the simple: do thing and you'll see why it's good - I'd like to see this in the whole SSI ecosystem :-D
12:08:53 From JC Ebersbach (identinet) to Everyone:
	we as a community should hire DHH (Ruby on Rails) to do an SSI tutorial ;-)
12:09:54 From Rob Aaron to Everyone:
	I've seen somewhere in DIF Discord or Slack about a WhatsApp/Signal replacement.
12:10:44 From Alex to Everyone:
	Signal with your blockchain account
12:11:12 From Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) to Everyone:
	For the DIDCOMM WG conversations, do we mostly use Slack or Discord?
12:11:36 From Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) to Everyone:
	Thk you
12:14:12 From Rob Aaron to Everyone:
	Thanks a ton!
12:14:14 From Fabio to Everyone:
	Thank you
12:14:18 From Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) to Everyone:
	Good job
12:14:20 From Rashmi Siravara to Everyone:
	Thank You Sam and everyone. DIDs are the way to go !!
12:14:32 From Brent Shambaugh to Everyone:
	I'll let you know if I struggle with understanding of did:registries for did:comm
12:14:46 From Brent Shambaugh to Everyone:
	thanks Sam
