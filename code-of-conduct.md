# DIF Code of Conduct


_Last Revised: 6/2/18_


DIF Members are expected to treat each other, and their respective organizations, with a level of respect that maintains a positive, inviting, comfortable atmosphere for interaction. The following are rules that Members shall comply with when communicating with or about other Members, both in DIF’s direct communication channels and other external mediums:

1. If a Member has an issue or concern about another Member, they should first address that Member privately. Not doing so, or doing so in a public channel, can result in a negative communication environment.
2. If a Member suspects another Member has errored in a way that harmed DIF, violated a rule, or caused a negative community outcome, they will either address the Member directly or bring their concern to the Steering Committee. Public assertions, accusations, and inferences of possible wrongdoing that have not proceeded through this process will not be tolerated.
3. Members should feel comfortable interacting in the wider identity and blockchain community, thus Members will not badger, bully, tail, attack, or repetitively harp on other Members with targeted statements in DIF’s communications channels, social media posts, or targeted content that a reasonable person would find negative, malicious, or pestering.
4. If a Member is collaborating with other Members on any projects, products, services, presentations, or developments that are not official DIF activities/events, other Members who are not directly participating should refrain from making negative, detractory, or divisive comments, statements, or assertions in public forms about any detail, activity, or outcome that a reasonable person would conclude is a matter between the participants.
   * Examples of negative, detractory, or divisive comments, statements, or assertions that Members should refrain from making in any public forums, DIF communication channels, or external mediums:
      1. “Most DIF Members are here for X” or “Most Members are here trying to do business with Member X”
         * Statements of this kind generally create a negative, hostile, or uncomfortable environment for communication and collaboration - they will not be tolerated.
      1. “I am disappointed that the collaboration/presentation between Members A, B, and C didn’t feature more of X” [inferring that a Member has slighted DIF or others]
         * While any Member may hold such opinion, it is highly inappropriate to assert in public forums that other Members, on their non-DIF time and collaborations, have committed a wrong against DIF or collaborating members. If a wrong has been committed in a private business or collaborative engagement, it is the business of the collaborating Members to discuss and settle any issues that may or may not have occured. If there is a genuine feeling that a violation of the DIF Code of Conduct has occurred, the concerned member shall bring it to the Steering Committee.
      1. Member A: “I think Member B may have violated DIF rules, or harmed the organization” or “I feel Member B is behaving as if the rules don’t apply to them”
         * These statements have no place in any public medium without being addressed with the target Member privately, then, if need be, the Steering Committee.
Consequences for Violations
As an open source organization where different groups from diverse backgrounds and industries are meant to work together for shared good, creating a welcoming, comfortable atmosphere for collaboration and communication between Members is one of DIF’s highest priorities. As a result, DIF takes violations of this Code of Conduct seriously, and will handle them as follows:


1. If a Member feels another Member has violated anything within the rules listed in the Code of Conduct above, the Member will bring their concern to the Steering Committee for evaluation in accordance with this procedure:
   * The SC will examine the evidence presented and vote on whether a violation has occurred. The SC will apply a reasonable person standard and decide based on a preponderance of what they review.
   * If the Member in question is a Steering Committee member, that member shall not be included in the vote/discussion.
1. If a Member is deemed by the Steering Committee to have violated one of the rules in the Code of Conduct above, they will be subject to the following:
   * The first violation will result in a one-time written reprimand from the Steering Committee.
   * Subsequent violations will result in an immediate suspension of 1 month, wherein the Member will have all access to DIF communications and voting rights stripped.
   * If the Member has had another violation (beyond the one-time warning) of this Code of Conduct within 1 year of another occurrence, their membership will be terminated, effective immediately.

DIF membership comes with a responsibility to uphold a level of respect and kindness in our interactions with others. This Code of Conduct helps set a positive standard for Member interactions, and is essential if we are to realize our shared goals for the decentralized identity ecosystem.
