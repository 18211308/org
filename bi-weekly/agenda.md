            * partly, this entails designing a query mechanism for communicating requests for key events that manages the multisig escrow and the duplicity-detection log
            * key threads to follow on github are the [Query Mode discussion](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/issues/109) (a whopper!), the broader [roadmapping thread](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/issues/108), and a conceptual/mental-model alignment thread on how the concept of the transaction-event log "TEL" is [evolving](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/issues/118) as KERI gets more complex and starts layering on security, duplicity-detection, multi-sig, etc.

        * no meeting since last bi-weekly
3. **Additional Agenda items**
    * Wallet Security - soon a WG, attend next week's meeting to close all outstanding comments on the charter. 
    * Hospitality & Travel SIG still [chartering](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uYlz3oVBDz-HKEtyO5CsCM1g3uhPxryy/edit) and holding exploratory meetings to tease technical requirements out of use cases founding members have been working on
    * **DIF Grants/Bounties/founded challenges** 
        * [Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MQllNfFvC3PiVi5jo_kT6OCq9w3_GoEGWjZb-0pwuys/edit) for managing it

### Agenda

1. **Welcome and introductions**
2. **Groups**
    * **Interop WG** (Kaliya, Pamela, Juan) - [meeting page](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/blob/master/agenda.md)
        * Last week: Intro to the Revocation Topic (first in a series- Martin Riedel gave a very even-handed overview of pros and cons of the three main types of status-check mechanism, and gave examples of each. Future sessions will cover proposed new mechanisms by DIF members, and some might even be led by guest-host Andreas Freitag, who is looking at how to evaluate them objectively against something like the DID-Rubric!
        * Today: Recently registered DID Methods- DID:Orb and DID:Tezos, with a discussion of how to design and specify and register future methods
    * **Identifiers & Discovery** (Markus, Sam) - [meeting page](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/blob/main/agenda.md)
        * Updates on Fuzzy Encryption project (C++ implementation released!), KERI (WG Charter pending SC approval)
        * DID-Dillo project- lightweight in-browser DIDKit build for resolving DIDs locally with UR fallback. 300kb microbrowser can run on a flipphone!
        * Helpful overview of DID Method registration process, multi-signature and verification method mechanics
        * Universal Registrar/Resolver & DIDComm: interesting work item afoot   
        * DID-Core update: Daniel Burnett gave a report 3 weeks ago at [interop WG](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/blob/master/agenda.md#agenda---3-feb-2021---useu-time-0600-pt---update-on-did-core-and-enterprise-ethereum-alliance-d-burnett-and-did-interop-fundamentals-markus-sabadello-and-guests), and Markus will give a more recent one next week

        * Gabe Cohen has had to step down from chairship, but will still be involved in specific work items. His colleague Daniel McGrogan has been nominated.
        * Presentation Exchange is in final-final [editorial](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/), and ready for review! 
        * VC Marketplace is still accepting use-case proposals, get in touch if you're interested in their VC business-model/marketplace-use-case sandbox/discussion group! Detailed discussions not just about payment and incentivization but also discovery mechanisms, semantic definition/propagation, etc, so bring your questions and use-cases and [get involved](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/vc-marketplace)!
        * [Credential Manifest](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/credential-manifest) still booting up and scoping, not too late to get involved if you're interested in how issuers differ from verifiers in their publication needs and mechanisms
        * Poke around the new work item [Schema Forms](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/schema-forms)- not an official work item, mostly just Daniel Buchner open-sourcing a open-ended project for JSON Schema form definition

    * **DID Auth** (Oliver, Kyle) *half hibernated state*
        * DIF-OIDF joint meetings - follow along on the [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues) issues if the timing doesn't work for you!

## Meeting - 9 December 2020 - (1100 ET) 
 
### Agenda

1. **Welcome and introductions**
2. **Groups**
    * **Interop WG** (Kaliya, Pamela, Juan) - [meeting page](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/blob/master/agenda.md)
        *  Introduction to [Spec Map](https://github.com/manicprogrammer/vc-spec-rel/) with researcher Michael Ruminer, talking about how to maintain it going forward

            *  Interop specifications discussion-- how to align with existing API standards?

        * [Method Spec Registry analytics](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/blob/main/agenda.md#meeting---30-nov-2020---1400-et-recording) and some possible directions for DIF-based efforts to structure DID Method comparison/review
            * Sam suggested to do analytics of DID method usage through Universal Resolver
            * Sophie suggested that authors/implementers should be asked to supply contact information
            * Juan mentioned journalists, researchers, and consultancies would all benefit from a common repository for neutral, factual information as well as self-assessments against the DID Rubric
        * Discussion around accessibility/usability of DID technology
            * it felt hard to get back to the topic and find the inside knowledge that's required to use DIDs.
            * Sophie agreed that it was hard to find things, there are too many documents and some broken links.
            * Eric suggested it would be good to have third-party journalistic review of DID methods.
        * Key roll-over and recovery
            * repo in IDWG for lists recovery methods we know about.
            * For the Confidential Storage (SDS) WG, key recovery is pretty much out of scope. 
            * There is essentially only a limited set of options (menmonic devices, secret sharing).
            * Biometrics must not be used as a primary private key ("you can't rotate biometrics"). Biometrics can be used to unlock a private key, i.e. as an authorization capability.

        * Recovation Workitem TBD (discuss with Gabe.)

    * **DID Auth** (Oliver, Kyle) *half hibernated state*
        * blog article about OIDF collaboration
