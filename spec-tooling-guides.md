*DIF Knowledgebase for members, work items, and communications:*

DIF recommends picking the spec-authoring tool most appropriate to the target audience and/or target Standards Development Organization (SDO).  If your work item can come to a consensus *up front* about an SDO that it wants to target from the beginning, we advise the group to work within the format and tooling preferences of that SDO from the begining.  If no clear SDO can be agreed to upfront, or if a "DIF-terminal" specification is consensual from the beginning, we recommend SpecUp, a markdown-based tool fit-for-purpose and designed by DIF's founding executive director.

The tools recommended by DIF are:
1. **[SpecUp](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/spec-up)** is a lightweight markdown generator similar to Jekyll, which is itself hosted and maintained as a standing DIF work item. 
2. **[BikeShed](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/)** is a general-purposes specification authoring tool with many features and settings, which may be a bit overwhelming for more junior/inexperienced audiences.
3. **[ReSpec](https://respec.org/docs/)** is the native specification tool of the W3C community, is a more bibliographically-oriented tool. Feature requests or questions about advanced configuration topics and customization should be directed to the [specification producers mailing list][https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/] and community group, which governs both respec and [spec prod](https://w3c.github.io/spec-prod/)/[echidna](https://w3c.github.io/spec-prod/#deploy-to-w3c-using-echidna), the github action that powers it.
4. **[XML2RFC](http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/)** is the preferred spec-authoring tool for IETF RFCs, but may require a bit of XML familiarity; it is also possible to generate RFCs from markdown files using the [markdown2rfc](https://github.com/oauthstuff/markdown2rfc) translator tool for more lightweight specs, or [BikeShed](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/) for more demanding specs.

## Educational materials

**SpecUp** education materials are forthcoming. In the meantime, see github [issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/spec-up/issues) at the repo. There is also a video of tool creator Daniel Buchner giving a [quick tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfMc5Has4s4) of key features.

**ReSpec** educational materials are also forthcoming.  In the meantime, see the [overview](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/specs.html) and [video](https://youtu.be/0eQXU6Z-A6Q) created by the W3C [CCG](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/)-- note that there are also instructions on how to generate ReSpec from markdown via github automation.

## Acknowledgements for Specs
As DIF is a place for collaboration, acknowledging work funded or done by others is a gesture to recognize the efforts behind ratified work items. Consider creating a section for acknowledgments and recognize specific grants, people, or organizations whose work was invaluable for the delivered work item.
