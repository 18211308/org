DIF recommends two different tools for writing specifications:
1. **SpecUp** is a lightweight markdown generator similar to Jekyll, hosted and maintained as a standing DIF work item.
2. **ReSpec**, the native specification tool of the broader W3C community, is a more bibliographically-oriented tool. Specifications that are intended as "standards-track," particularly those intended for W3C, are recommended to use ReSpec (or switch to ReSpec if they decide along the way).

### Educational materials

**SpecUp** education materials are forthcoming. In the meantime, see github [issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/spec-up/issues) at the repo. There is also a video of tool creator Daniel Buchner giving a [quick tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfMc5Has4s4) of key features.

**ReSpec** educational materials are also forthcoming.  In the meantime, see the [overview](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/specs.html) and [video](https://youtu.be/0eQXU6Z-A6Q) created by the W3C [CCG](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/)-- note that there are also instructions on how to generate ReSpec from markdown via github automation.
