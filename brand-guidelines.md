These guidelines apply to use of the DIF trademarks.  The DIF Brand Guidelines, available at https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org, also apply to any use of the DIF trademarks.

In addition to the generally applicable rules discussed in The DIF Brand Guidelines, there are a few specific rules that we ask everyone to follow when using trademarks related to one of the DIF projects or the organization itself.

* When referring to a specific DIF software project, do use the full project name (e.g., “Acme uses DIF Universal Resolver”) and do refer to it as a “framework” or a “tool,” as appropriate (e.g., “the DIF Universal Resolver”, “the DIF DID Auth libraries”). Once you establish DIF as the project source, you may use the name of the project without the “DIF” leading preface for further mentions within the same text/presentation, so long as you do not replace the preceding words with your company’s name or other words, marks, or text that infers the project is something other than a DIF production.
* Do help promote DIF in a vendor-neutral way.  Where necessary to highlight the initial code contributor, do use the name of the codebase followed by “the technology initially contributed by …” (e.g., “DIF Identity Hub, the technology initially contributed by …”).
* Do let DIF staff know if you plan an event or are putting out a press release centered around or mentioning DIF. While this is not something that requires review and approval, DIF appreciates when members alert the Foundation to such communications and events. We do suggest you include the short DIF official introductory presentation as part of your meetup or event.
* Don’t use “DIF Project” to refer to the organization.  As noted above, DIF hosts many software projects.  Similarly, don’t use “DIF Project” when you are referring to a specific project hosted by DIF (e.g., “Acme did a proof of concept on DIF” should be “Acme did a proof of concept using the DIF Universal Resolver”).
* Don’t modify the DIF trademarks or logos (e.g., do not add hyphens, periods, or other characters, or change the colors, orientation or any other visual aspect of any logos).
* Don’t use any DIF trademark in a misleading way, which includes the following:
   * Don’t use DIF trademarks in connection with any products or services that are not related to, built for or associated with the software projects hosted by the DIF organization.
   * Don’t use your company name possessively with the DIF organization or a specific hosted project (e.g., “Acme’s DIF,” “Acme’s DID Auth library,” “Identity Hub by Acme,” “Acme’s DIF Project,” “Acme’s implementation of the Universal Resolver”). Once you establish DIF as the project source, you may use the name of the project without the “DIF” leading preface for further mentions within the same text/presentation, so long as you do not replace the preceding words with your company’s name or other words, marks, and text that infers the project is something other than a DIF production.
   * Don’t add your company logo(s) on DIF marketing materials, such as official presentations, unless expressly permitted to do so by DIF staff. Don’t create marketing materials that look like they are coming from DIF rather than your company.
   * Don’t use the DIF logo larger than your own company’s logo(s).
   * Don’t use the DIF trademarks in a way that creates a sense of endorsement, sponsorship, or false association with DIF (e.g., “DIF approved,” “DIF certified,” “a product by a DIF member”) or in connection with a project that has not been accepted into the DIF organization.
   * Don’t deliberately give the impression that a company is the “main” company behind DIF, associate DIF with a single project or company, or is otherwise harmful to the organization, its members or other projects.


Do not use the DIF brand in a way that is inconsistent with the The DIF Brand Guidelines unless you have obtained explicit written permission from the DIF organization to do so.

## Guidelines for Products/Services Built with DIF Technologies

* Do use the following format and wording to describe how DIF projects support a product or service offering:
   * [Vendor name] [Product name] [Product version]* for -OR- based on -OR- powered by DIF [Project] [Project version]*
   * *Product Version and Project Version are optional for marketing materials, but must be included in tech specs
   * E.g. Acme Blockchain Services (v1.4) powered by DIF Universal Resolver (v1.0)


### Activities that require approvals:


* Communications that reference DIF branding, content, and technology shall be generally permitted, so long as they are created in good faith to highlight the work in DIF, genuine use of that work, and do not infer sponsorship, partnership, or any special relationship between DIF and any organization, product, or service it mentions. Any use that deviates from this is required to be approved by the DIF PR team, which can be reached at communication@identity.foundation
* You may not use our marks in domain names for non-DIF-related products or services without prior approval. Nor can you use brands on your own web pages in a way that represents a non-DIF-related product or service offering, without our prior approval. Obtain approval via communication@identity.foundation
* We recommend that pure PR/marketing material in which you plan to use the words “DIF” or any of our project brands, be submit to communication@identity.foundation for discussion and approval.

longer DIF description | `blurb`  | This organization was formed as a Joint Development Foundation project in 2017 and has grown to be a major venue for IPR-protected co-development among large and small industry players. It has historically focused on the development of both working open-source code and pre-standard specifications for decentralized identity, but it is starting to branch out into non-technical forms of cooperation for the purposes of market-building and to promote all open decentralized identity technology, whether created in DIF or elsewhere. |  |
